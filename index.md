### CPSC 120

* Lab 5

  Lab 5, part 2 was one of my favorite labs to work on. It was one of the first labs we have done in class and it's when I finally felt like a true programmer. In this lab we worked on making the game BlackJack. It was confusing to work on but once finished, I realized how simple of a game it was.

* Lab 10

  Lab 10, part 2 was an interesting lab to work on due it feeling more complex compared to Previous. In this lab, we worked on organizing the population of California by county. This gave an insight to how these data structures are used to keep track of population data. These types of codes are used for research purposes and can also be used for political polls. 

* Lab 1

  Lab 1, This will always be my favorite. It was the first step we took to becoming a programmer. In this lab, we were able to print out Hello World. It is such a simple task that anyone can do and it felt so refreshing starting the journey on that simple note.
